# Milestone-Project-2
NYU MERN milestone project
The Modern Movie Portal is a movie rating website. We have the movies displayed with their title, rated, display picture genre and duration.
We created it using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. Thus website is used to create, read, update and delete movie reviews and ratings.

Milestone Project 2 & 3 Guidelines:
Day 1: Agree on a project idea, write up the basic requirements that the project should be able to do, create frontend and backend repo, decide who will build the frontend skeleton and backend skeleton
Day 2: Intro to Agile Standup, Complete the frontend and backend skeletons, basic database schema designed, connect backend app to Sequelize if using Postgres (Mongoose if using mongo), create your tables in the db, UIUX designs for the frontend are started (Wireframes, journey maps, user personas), create your landing page in the frontend.
Day 3: The frontend hits an endpoint of the backend and gets some data to populate one page, one frontend page is finished, different team members can contribute to different parts of the app easily since the skeleton for both frontend and backend is done
Day 4: Deploy your basic full stack application to Heroku, add more pages, more styling, more endpoints, more functionality
Day 5: More pages, more styling, more endpoints, more functionality, worked on presentation and ensure each group member has something to talk about
Day 6: Presentations



Key Milestones For Progress
Create repositories & add all members of the team as collaborators
Create the skeleton of the frontend and backend apps. Skeleton means just the basic folder and file structure for each app. This will allow your team to collaborate more easily without as many conflicts.
Create your database schema & create your backend app model classes using Sequelize if Postgres, or Mongoose if MongoDB. Create a wireframe for your frontend pages and start thinking about your user personas so you can create a journey map
Have both the frontend and backend app running locally, and hit a backend endpoint successfully from the frontend app and display the data on the frontend
Get both the frontend and backend apps deployed to Heroku
Add more endpoints, more styling, more pages
